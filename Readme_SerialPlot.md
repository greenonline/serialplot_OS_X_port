# What is SerialPlot?

SerialPlot is graphing application that uses the serial port as a data source. An example of use is to replace the limited graphing facility built in to the Arduino IDE.
It is built primarily for OS X, but may work on Win32/64 and Linux, with a little coaxing.

# How to build SerialPlot?

## Summary

The entire process can be summarised into the following steps:

1. Create a workspace directory to put the source files in, i.e. `~/qt-workspace`.
2. Download required source files
   1. [pvd](https://github.com/pvd)/[**SerialPlot**](https://github.com/pvd/SerialPlot)
   2. [qextserialport](https://github.com/qextserialport)/[**qextserialport**](https://github.com/qextserialport/qextserialport)
   3. [qwt 6.0.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qwt/files/qwt/6.0.1/)
3. Unzip and place all three in the workspace. Ensure that the directory names match the names of `.pro` files (i.e., no version numbers):
   - `SerialPlot`
   - `qextserialport`
   - `qwt`
4. Install [QtCreator 4.5](https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qtcreator/4.5/4.5.0/qt-creator-opensource-mac-x86_64-4.5.0.dmg) from the [repository](https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qtcreator/4.5/4.5.0/)
5. Install `qt` library, 4 or 5:
   - Either
      - `brew tap cartr/qt4`
      - `brew tap-pin cartr/qt4`
      - `brew install qt@4`
   - or
      - `brew install cartr/qt4/pyqt@4`
6. Install `qwt` (not strictly necessary as we are going to build the framework anyway)
   - `brew install qwt`
7. Create a `qt` directory in the workspace and within it symlink to the `include` directory under the qt install location.
8. Modify the following `.pro` files under the `qwt/` directory, to use `INCLUDEPATH`
   1. `src/src.pro`
   2. `textengines/mathml/mathml.pro`
   3. `designer/designer.pro`
9. Modify `SerialPlot.pro` to point to the correct directories
10. Build in this order:
    1. `qwt`
    2. `qextserialport`
    3. `SerialPlot`

## Details

Note that all of the following was done in a terminal, rather than use QtCreator.

### Pre-requisite - qt

Note: You will need to install qt first (see at the top of the page)
```
brew tap cartr/qt4
brew install qt@4
```
Link in `/etc`
```
ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/qt@4/4.8.7_6_reinstall/etc/qt4 /usr/local/etc/qt4
```
### Setting up the workspace

Create a new directory `~/qtcode2` and place within it new (and freshly unzipped) versions of the packages (`qwt-6.0.1`, `SerialPlot` and `qextserialport`) .

Add a new directory `~/qtcode2/qt`, into which add a symlink to the `qt4/include` directory
```
$ ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/qt4/4.8.7_6.reinstall/include include
```
This is purely for the ease of specifying the include paths for the compilation of `qwt`.

### qwt - using `INCLUDEPATH`

Regarding compiling qwt, in order to not have to copy over all of the headers, use `INCLUDEPATH`, in each of the projects' `.pro` files (`src.pro`, `mathml.pro` and `designer.pro`) taking into consideration the *depth* of the individual `.pro` files, within the directory hierarchy. See this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2752396/4424636) to [How to add include path in Qt Creator?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2752352/4424636)

Note that nothing needs to be added to `qwt.pro` itself.

Add to `src/src.pro` the following:
```
INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/../../qt/include/QtSvg
```
Note the double parent folders `/../../` as `qwt/src` is two directory levels deep

In `textengines/mathml/mathml.pro`
```
INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/../../../qt/include/QtXml
```
Note the triple parent folder navigation, `/../../../` as `qwt/textengines/mathml/` is three directory levels deep

In `designer/designer.pro`
```
INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/../../qt/include/QtDesigner
INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/../../qt/include
```
Note the `qt/include` is for access to `QtDesigner/sdk_global.h` as the path is within the `#include`

Then run `qmake`
```
$ /usr/local/Cellar/qt@4/4.8.7_6.reinstall/bin/qmake qwt.pro
```
and finally `make`.

After that you get the `rcc` error
```
compiling moc/moc_qwt_designer_plotdialog.cpp
rcc qwt_designer_plugin.qrc
Error: unknown command "qwt_designer_plugin" for "rcc"
Run 'rcc --help' for usage.
Error: [rcc v9.16.0] unknown command "qwt_designer_plugin" for "rcc"
make[1]: *** [resources/qrc_qwt_designer_plugin.cpp] Error 1
make: *** [sub-designer-make_default-ordered] Error 2
$ 
```

To avoid this, omit the building of QwtDesigner by commenting out the following line, in `qwtconfig.pri`
```
QWT_CONFIG     += QwtDesigner
```
Then run `qmake` again
```
$ /usr/local/Cellar/qt@4/4.8.7_6.reinstall/bin/qmake qwt.pro
```
and finally `make`.

### qextserialport

No changes required to the `.pro` file. Just run `qmake`
```
/usr/local/Cellar/qt@4/4.8.7_6.reinstall/bin/qmake qextserialport.pro 
```
and then `make`.

### SerialPlot

In `SerialPlot.pro` change the path to `qwt/`
```
include(../qextserialport/src/qextserialport.pri)  # mgj

#win32:CONFIG(release, debug|release): LIBS += -L$$PWD/../qwt-6.0.1/lib/release/ -lqwt
#else:win32:CONFIG(debug, debug|release): LIBS += -L$$PWD/../qwt-6.0.1/lib/debug/ -lqwt
#else:mac: LIBS += -F$$PWD/../qwt-6.0.1/lib/ -framework qwt
#else:unix: LIBS += -L$$PWD/../qwt-6.0.1/lib/ -lqwt

#INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/../qwt-6.0.1/src
#DEPENDPATH += $$PWD/../qwt-6.0.1/src

win32:CONFIG(release, debug|release): LIBS += -L$$PWD/../qwt/lib/release/ -lqwt
else:win32:CONFIG(debug, debug|release): LIBS += -L$$PWD/../qwt/lib/debug/ -lqwt
else:mac: LIBS += -F$$PWD/../qwt/ -framework qwt
else:unix: LIBS += -L$$PWD/../qwt/ -lqwt

INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/../qwt/src
DEPENDPATH += $$PWD/../qwt/src
```
and change the location of the dynlibs
```
#win32:CONFIG(release, debug|release): LIBS += -L$$PWD/../qextserialport/src/build/ -lqextserialport
#else:win32:CONFIG(debug, debug|release): LIBS += -L$$PWD/../qextserialport/src/build/ -lqextserialportd
#else:unix:!symbian: LIBS += -L$$PWD/../qextserialport/src/build/ -lqextserialport

win32:CONFIG(release, debug|release): LIBS += -L$$PWD/../qextserialport/ -lqextserialport
else:win32:CONFIG(debug, debug|release): LIBS += -L$$PWD/../qextserialport/ -lqextserialportd
else:unix:!symbian: LIBS += -L$$PWD/../qextserialport/ -lqextserialport
```

Run `qmake`
```
$ /usr/local/Cellar/qt@4/4.8.7_6.reinstall/bin/qmake SerialPlot.pro
```
then `make`

Finally an application is created.

However it crashes with the error:
```
Dyld Error Message:
  Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libqextserialport.1.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/USER/*/SerialPlot.app/Contents/MacOS/SerialPlot
  Reason: image not found
```
Copy all four release (not debug) `.dylib` files from the `qexterialport` directory to `/usr/local/lib`

and then the application runs:

## Bundling the Qwt and Qt frameworks into SerialPlot

To make SerialPlot portable, the Qwt and Qt frameworks, upon which SerialPlot depends, need to be bundled into the `SerialPlot.app` application bundle.
